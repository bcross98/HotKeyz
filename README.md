# MCScript

TO RUN:
1.) Get python 3 - https://www.python.org/downloads/
1a.) Restart your pc if you can't type in the following commands
2.) Get pyautogui - in cmd type: pip install pyautogui
3.) Get keyboard - in cmd type: pip install keyboard
4.) Restart your pc

#Where I left off:
-Automate switching iron picks
-Add a function that checks if the computer has pyautogui and keyboard installed
-Add sound detection for when a pick/sword/etc... breaks
-Instead of 'e' to fully exit, 'e' to back to the main menu
