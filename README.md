WHAT I DO:

-XP Farm) This is for any farm where you have to left click, it runs until you press 'e'
-Gold Farm) This is for any farm where you have to right click, it runs until you press 'e'

#Where I left off/What I want to do:
-Add sound detection for when a pick/sword/etc... breaks
-Redo Complex Cobblestone function
-Refactor the cobblestone functions
-Refactor the listener functions/ threading functions
