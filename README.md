# MCScript

INFO:
I built this because I'm lazy. You're given 3 options: 1.) A simple cobblestone afk.Best option for only 1 pick. 2.) A complex cobblestone afk. Best for multiple picks, will switch automatically. 3.) XP/Mob farm afk. Works for xp farms and mob farms. Runs on a 0.5sec interval so it doesn't break armor stands.


TO RUN:
1.) Get python 3 - https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NCVDN91XZQP?ocid=pdpshare
2.) Get pyautogui - in cmd type: pip install pyautogui
3.) Get keyboard - in cmd type: pip install keyboard
