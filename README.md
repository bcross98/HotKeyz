WHAT I DO:
-Cobblestone) This is for cobblestone generators, you have the option of either using 1 pick (runs until an iron pick breaks) or using multiple picks (runs until a select number of picks break. Will auto switch, make sure all picks are in your hotbar starting left to right)
-XP Farm) This is for any farm where you have to left click, it runs until you press 'e'
-Gold Farm) This is for any farm where you have to right click, it runs until you press 'e'

#Where I left off/What I want to do:
-Add sound detection for when a pick/sword/etc... breaks
-Redo Complex Cobblestone function
-Refactor the cobblestone functions
-Refactor the listener functions/ threading functions
